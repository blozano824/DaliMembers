# Welcome to the DALI Member app!📱🖥🙎🙎‍♂️


Hey! This app was designed to complete challenge #2 of my DALI Lab 2018 Spring application. [Brayan Lozano '20](https://www.brayanlozano.com).

:clipboard: Features
----------------------------------------------------

Version 1 fetches a JSON file from DALI's servers with information about its members, their hometown, and other details. Using this JSON, labels are generated for each member that displays their photo, their name, their quote. Once pressed, a modal appears displaying more information such as a map with their hometown, the projects they have worked on, and even the terms they have worked with DALI. If their photo is clicked, the user is redirected to the members personal website in Safari. This version was strictly built and designed for iOS but will still compile for android.


:wrench: How it Was Built
-------------

This app was entirely built using React Native and several community built node modules.
> **Modules:**
> - **[React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)** is used for building all core components and provides compatibility for iOS and Android.
> - **[React Native Modal](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-modal)** is used for creating modals to display more information.
> - **[React Native Google Static Map](https://github.com/yelled3/react-native-google-static-map)** is used for displaying each members hometown using longtitude and latitude coordinates.
> - **[React Native Iphone X Helper](https://github.com/ptelad/react-native-iphone-x-helper)** is used for displaying properly sized headers on iPhone X displays
